# 2.6 Example of Algorithm Analysis

### Examples

# 2.1 Sequential search

## Sequential search
  
  Sequential search implementation.

  ```
  gcc seq-search.c -o seq-search

  ./seq-search 10
  ```

  Run program with argument a, the sorted collection [1, ..., a] will be generated. Then provide program with value to search for in the collection one at a time, to find its index in the collection.

# 2.2 Binary search

## Binary search
  
  Binary search implementation.

  ```
  gcc binary.c -o binary

  ./binary 10
  ```

  Run program with argument a, the sorted collection [1, ..., a] will be generated. Then provide program with value to search for in the collection one at a time, to find its index in the collection.
